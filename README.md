# ANPR-Vehicle-Finder
Stolen-Vehicle-Detection-ANPR is a proof-of-concept project using OpenCV and Tesseract to detect stolen vehicles via ANPR. It captures vehicle images, extracts license plates, and matches them against a database of stolen vehicles, sending email alerts to owners if a match is found.
